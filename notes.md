# Questions

- [ ] not going to have paper done
- [ ] ![wtheta plot](./plots/wtheta.png) what's wrong?
- [ ] Theta bins: range, number, lin or log space? go a few degrees past signal
- [ ] Redshift bins: how wide?


# To Do

- [ ] Redshift calculation

generally correlation fnc integrated over entire space must = 0
part of the integral constraint is real and part is an artifact
paper by Andrew J.S. Hamilton and Max Tegmark, late 90's
test integral constraint with Bolshoi
one thing correlation function tells you is fluctuation of number density on scale of box/theta (sample or cosmic variance)

- [x]  why do peculiar velocities scatter redshift more towards observer than away

    * The do not! see zoom in of ![](./plots/gals_rvsz.png)
