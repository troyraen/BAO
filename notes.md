# Questions

- [ ] ![wtheta plot](./plots/wtheta.png) what's wrong?
- [x] Theta bins: range, number, lin or log space?
        * ANS: go a few degrees past signal. try different spacings
- [ ] ![zwtheta plot](./plots/zwtheta.png): d_BAO = 150Mpc so need r(z) in Mpc, not Mpc/h?
- [ ] Redshift bins: how wide?

# DOING

- [ ] try current main.py, z4push=0

# To Do

- [x] wtheta plot: subplots with rows Nstack, cols Nrands/Ngals

- [ ] Redshift calculation
- [ ] test integral constraint with Bolshoi
    * generally correlation fnc integrated over entire space must = 0
    * part of the integral constraint is real and part is an artifact
    * test integral constraint with Bolshoi
    * one thing correlation function tells you is fluctuation of number density on scale of box/theta (sample or cosmic variance)

- [x]  why do peculiar velocities scatter redshift more towards observer than away
